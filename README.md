# Sidecar for Leetcode

Bring 400+ AI models to your Leetcode practice with a single OpenRouter API key. The extension can (with permission) read the problem you’re viewing and write back to your code editor—so you get targeted help without switching tabs. Perfect for learning efficiently and staying in flow on sites like LeetCode.

Features:

- Learn Mode (default): Get 1–2 high-leverage hints first, never the full solution unless you ask—just like a real coach.
- Agent Mode: Let the AI safely propose edits in your code editor and review them with a VS Code–style diff (for models that support tool calling).
- Pattern-Focused Guidance: Spot sliding windows, monotonic stacks, greedy strategies, and more—so you can reuse them across problems.
- Reasoning Controls: Use advanced reasoning models and watch their thought process stream live in the chat. Adjust the effort level (low / medium / high) when you need the model to think longer and more deeply.
- Huge Model Catalog: Tap into 400+ models via OpenRouter, including many free ones (often up to \~1000 requests/day).
- Stay in One Tab: Live read/write access means the AI sees the exact problem and code you’re working on—no copy-paste shuffle.
